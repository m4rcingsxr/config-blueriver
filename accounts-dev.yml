eureka:
  instance:
    preferIpAddress: true
    # When registering with Eureka, prefer the machine's IP address over its hostname.
    # Useful in Docker or Kubernetes, where hostnames may not resolve correctly across containers.

  client:
    registerWithEureka: true
    # This microservice should register itself with Eureka so that other services can discover it.

    fetchRegistry: true
    # This microservice should fetch the registry (list of all services) from Eureka,
    # so it can discover and communicate with other registered services.

    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: "http://eureka-server:8070/eureka/"
      # The Eureka server’s URL where this client will register and fetch the registry.
      # In a real setup inside Docker or Kubernetes, replace 'localhost' with the Eureka server's hostname or service name.

      slidingWindowSize: 10
      # Number of calls recorded in the sliding window (successes + failures).
      # Failures are counted against this window to calculate the failure rate.
      # Example: with 10, the breaker will decide based on the last 10 calls.

      permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 2
      # When the breaker transitions from OPEN → HALF_OPEN,
      # this defines how many trial calls are allowed to test recovery.
      # If these succeed, the breaker closes again. If they fail, it reopens.

      failureRateThreshold: 50
      # Percentage of failed calls in the sliding window that will trip the breaker.
      # Example: if 50% or more of the last N calls failed, the breaker opens.

      waitDurationInOpenState: 10000
      # How long (in milliseconds) the breaker stays OPEN before moving to HALF_OPEN.
      # During this time, all calls are immediately short-circuited (fallback triggered).
      # After this duration, trial calls are permitted again.
