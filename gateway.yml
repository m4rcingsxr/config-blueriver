eureka:
  instance:
    preferIpAddress: true
    # When registering with Eureka, prefer the machine's IP address over its hostname.
    # Useful in Docker or Kubernetes, where hostnames may not resolve correctly across containers.

  client:
    registerWithEureka: true
    # This microservice should register itself with Eureka so that other services can discover it.

    fetchRegistry: true
    # This microservice should fetch the registry (list of all services) from Eureka,
    # so it can discover and communicate with other registered services.

    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: "http://eureka-server:8070/eureka/"
      # The Eureka serverâ€™s URL where this client will register and fetch the registry.
      # In a real setup inside Docker or Kubernetes, replace 'localhost' with the Eureka server's hostname or service name.
